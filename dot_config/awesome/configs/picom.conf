# all windows come from right to left

# (smart-x, smart-y) are smart direction that will check if there are 
# multiple windows that splits the screen and will change their directions,
# in "smart-x" it changes direction of left window to "right" and direction of 
# right window to "left", if screen is not splited and a window is taking 
# a lot of screen it will change that window direction to "left".

# "right" and "left", it translate to "top" and "bottom"

# e.g: use "none: window_type = 'popup_menu'" for disabling transitions on popup menus
